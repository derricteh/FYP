\f0\fs24 \cf0 Your output file should be in JSON format representing a Python dictionary. For each image, use the image IDs, as originally given in the data files, as the key, and your prediction as the value (represented as a string).  The specific output file name is not important.  A sample submission, sample_response.txt, can be found in the ZIP file; notice this file is significantly smaller than what your actual output file should look like.\
